# FreeCodeCamp Challenges

Solutions to coding challenges from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## About

FreeCodeCamp offers a comprehensive curriculum covering web development, algorithms, data structures, and more. This directory contains my solutions to their coding challenges, implemented in TypeScript with full test coverage.

## Problems Solved

| #                           | Problem              | Date Solved |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| [145](src/freecodecamp/145) | Nth Fibonacci Number | 2026-01-07  |
| [149](src/freecodecamp/145) | vOwElcAsE            | 2026-01-07  |

## Workflow

### Start a new problem

```bash
npm run start:fcc <problem-number>

# Example:
npm run start:fcc 145
```

This creates:

- Branch: `freecodecamp/problem/<number>`
- Directory: `src/freecodecamp/<number>/`
- Files: `PROBLEM.md`, `solution.ts`, `solution.test.ts`

### Solve and commit

```bash
# After implementing and testing
npm run solve:fcc <problem-number> "<problem-name>"

# Example:
npm run solve:fcc 145 "Symmetric Difference"

# Dry run (preview changes)
npm run solve:fcc -- 145 "Symmetric Difference" --dry-run
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all FreeCodeCamp tests
npm test freecodecamp

# Run specific problem tests
npm test freecodecamp/145

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch freecodecamp
```
